# **KNN AS A FEATURE ENGINE**

KNN as a Feature Engine can aid in ensemble learning by quantifying anecdotal knowledge through supervised machine learning.
A good example would be targeting a minority group of customers who are known to have a desirable trait (e.g., similar features/patterns in customer behavior indicative of higher ‘value’ buyers, etc.).
- Part one of this two-part series reviews model transformations, metric evaluation, and practices for implementing KNN as a Feature Engine whilst giving users a self-containing script to follow.
- Part two of this two-part series incorporates the KNN Feature Engine from part one into different ensemble models and reviews the findings
